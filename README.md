## Oh, hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carmen Shiu, a full-stack software engineer.
My passion for coding started when I created fan sites for music artists in my youth, using drag-and-drop platforms like Angelfire and Geocities*, and later teaching myself HTML, CSS, and PHP. After going to school for PR and becoming a project manager-turned-product manager for 11 years, I realized it was time for a career change and enrolled in App Academy.

Now, as a full-stack software engineer, I'm building dynamic web applications, applying the professional skills I've developed over the years, andâ€”more importantlyâ€”finally pursuing that childhood passion of mine.

<i>*Yes, I'm dating myself here.</i>
