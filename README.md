### Oh, hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carmen Shiu, a full-stack software engineer.

  <div width="200px">
    <p>My passion for coding started when I created fan sites for music artists in my youth, using drag-and-drop platforms like Angelfire and Geocities*, and later teaching myself HTML, CSS, and PHP. After going to school for PR and becoming a project manager-turned-product manager for 11 years, I realized it was time for a career change and enrolled in App Academy.</p>
    <p>Now, as a full-stack software engineer, I'm building dynamic web applications, applying the professional skills I've developed over the years, andâ€”more importantlyâ€”finally pursuing that childhood passion of mine.</p>
